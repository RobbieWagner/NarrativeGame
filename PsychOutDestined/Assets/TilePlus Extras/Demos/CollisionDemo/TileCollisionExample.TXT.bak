CollisionDemo shows how you can have tiles that react to the environment.
One way to do this is physics, and in a trip down the rabbit hole, I wanted to see
if it was possible to map collisions to tiles. 

The scene TileCollisionDemo illustrates how extensions like ICollidableTile, 
TilePlusCollidableBase, TileCollision, and AnimatedTileWithCollision, and 
TilemapCollisionDirector do this, but the positioning isn't too accurate for a 
number of reasons. If your interactive tiles are fairly far apart this scheme 
could be useful.

The important thing to note here is that the non-animated (Star) tiles in the 
CollisionDemo scene are all clones of a single TileCollision tile asset with individual 
changes for force applied, etc. You can edit these variables yourself via the
Selection Inspector (use the Palette's picking function).

The Animated tile in the center is also modified from the original asset in the Project.
The 6-frame animation sequence from the Asset in the Project has been reduced to 3-frames. 
Lists like the Animation sequence can be edited in a normal inspector: just select the painted
tile with the Tile+Brush and click the 'I' button. 

Note that the reference to the "Effect Prefab" is added to each painted (Star) 
tile via the Tile+Brush Selection Inspector. 

For each of the painted tiles, the AudioSource reference is added with the Selection
Inspector as well. 

The animated tile in the center uses the TilePlusTiming helper class. If you select the
tilemap prior to activating Play mode, you'll notice that the TilePlusRuntimeEvents 
component is added dynamically the first time that that tile is collided with. 

These scripts are provided as examples only, and aren't supported in any way.
